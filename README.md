## 🔥 Project Highlights

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed null values and handled missing data.
- Converted categorical variables to numerical.
- Dropped irrelevant or duplicate columns.

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Studied relationships between variables like **price**, **location**, **cuisine**, and **rating**.
- Created beautiful visualizations (bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps).

### 3. 🤖 Model Building
- Applied **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree Regression**.
- Selected best performing model based on evaluation metrics.
- Built prediction models for:
  - Restaurant Rating Prediction
  - Price Range Analysis

### 4. 🌐 Streamlit App
- Interactive web interface to upload data.
- Predict restaurant ratings based on input features.
- Display EDA insights visually.
